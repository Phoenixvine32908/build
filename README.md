# Rankup3

## Installation

Rankup can be compiled with the `gradlew build` command. The compiled plugin jar will be in the `/build/libs` directory. A gradle wrapper is included, so installation of Gradle is not necessary.

## Translation

If you would like to contribute to translating the plugin, you can fork it.
Locale names are in ISO-639-1 and are in the folder [`src/main/resources/locale`](https://github.com/okx-code/Rankup3/tree/master/src/main/resources/locale)

When a locale is added, it should be saved [here](https://github.com/okx-code/Rankup3/blob/master/src/main/java/sh/okx/rankup/RankupPlugin.java#L294), ie through adding a line such as `saveLocale("es");`. However, I can do it if you forget.

You can use the [English](https://github.com/okx-code/Rankup3/blob/master/src/main/resources/locale/en.yml) locale to help translate.

Locales should be added or modified with a pull request, but if you wish to contribute often I can give you push access to this branch.

Here is a blank template for new locales:

```yaml
rankup:
  requirements-not-met: 
  no-rankup: 
  success-public: 
  success-private:
